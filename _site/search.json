    "text": "Honor Code and Learning Environment\nThe Illinois Student Code states: “It is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.” Note that you are subject to the Honor Code, as well as procedures for addressing violations to the Code, regardless of whether you have read it and understand it. According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”\nTo meet this standard in this class, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss the assignments with your peers, all of your data collection, analysis, and writing should be your own. Sharing of data sources you have been assigned to collect is a violation of the honor code in this course. The penalty for failing to meet the principles or spirit of the honor code may include automatic failure of the assignment or the class, at the discretion of the instructor.\nThe Department of Urban and Regional Planning is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is rooted in the goals and responsibilities of professional planners. By enrolling in a class offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, students agree to be responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect in all activities, including lectures, discussions, labs, projects, and extracurricular programs. See Student Code Article 1-Student Rights and Responsibilities, Part 1. Student Rights: §1-102.\n\nHealth and Safety\nFollowing University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of the community. If you feel ill, do not come to class. In addition, if you test positive for COVID-19 or have had an exposure that requires testing and/or quarantine, do not attend class. Please notify me, and at my discretion, you will be given excused absences for these class sessions. We will also develop a plan to discuss how to make up any missed work.\n\n\nStaying in Touch\nAs you learn and face challenges this semester, I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can.\n\n\nSexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation\nThe University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University’s Title IX and Disability Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX and Disability Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options.\nA list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found here. Other information about resources and reporting is available at wecare.illinois.edu.\n\n\nMental Health\nThe University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings which are covered through the Student Health Fee. If you or someone you know experiences mental health concerns, please contact or visit any of the University’s resources provided below. Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do for yourself and for those who care about you.\n\nCounseling Center: (217) 333-3704\nMcKinley Health Center: (217) 333-2700\n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: (800) 273-8255\nRosecrance Crisis Line (217) 359-4141\n\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911."

How does where you’re currently at relate to where you see yourself in the next five to ten years?\nStatement of personal and professional goals - articulate a minimum of four personal and professional goals in service of the vision you described in your self assessment. Make sure that the goals you articulate are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This means you will have to provide sufficient details for each goal to make them useful in this plan.\nSkills and abilities - describe the skills and abilities you have or will need to develop in order to accomplish your ten-year vision. In your description, be specific about how particular skills and abilities will contribute to your professional development.\nResources identified / needed - identify resources for professional development that will help you and provide your own assessment of resources needed to achieve your goals. Resources could include specific skills and training, mentoring, professional networks, or services.\nKey actions, timeline, and progress steps - describe key actions you plan to take with details on their timing and ways in which you will track your progress. Divide this section into actions you plan to take during your time at Illinois and actions you plan to take after you matriculate.\n\nThere is no prescribed length for the professional development plan. The details you choose to add are an investment by yourself for yourself. Details will also help me and others in the department serve more effectively as a resource to you, however, it is up to you to ensure that this plan is a usable one."
