## What is the Capstone?

The MUP capstone provides MUP students with the opportunity to apply what they have learned through their courses and internships to a specific planning problem or issue, and therefore to demonstrate their professional competence to both the faculty, potential employers, and the public.

## What Components Am I Responsible For?

The MUP Program requires that all students preparing to graduate produce three main deliverables in partial fulfillment of graduation capstone requirements:

1.  The MUP Portfolio
2.  The MUP Poster
3.  A Signed Capstone Exit Form (and the accompanying capstone manuscript for students completing the Project or Thesis options)

### Component Breakdown

These deliverables help to summarize your time and knowledge acquired in the MUP program.

-   **The MUP Portfolio** provides a holistic summary of your professional capacities and vision for practice.

-   **The MUP Poster** summarizes one important work that reflects your professional identity.

-   **The Capstone Manuscript** exemplifies your work as a planning practitioner (in the case of the Workshop or Project options) or planning researcher (in the case of the Thesis option).

As a department, we use these deliverables in three ways:

1.  To **celebrate and record** your significant accomplishments during your time as a graduate student at Illinois.
2.  To **assess your capacity** to apply key knowledge acquired as a Masters student to advanced practice.
3.  To **assess your learning** in accordance with university and accreditation learning outcomes assessment requirements.

: Key Capstone Dates Spring 2025

### Thesis Date Considerations

Thesis submissions are subject to additional timing guidelines established by the Graduate College. The [Thesis Deadlines Calendar](https://calendars.illinois.edu/list/3259) contains specific information about Graduate College thesis deadlines. Specific [guidelines for thesis development](https://grad.illinois.edu/academics/thesis-dissertation) and instructions for [thesis submission](https://grad.illinois.edu/academics/thesis-dissertation/submit-your-thesis) are also available.

It is strongly recommended that you schedule your thesis defense for *at least* 1-2 weeks before the deposit deadline so that you have adequate time to revise your thesis based upon committee comments during your defense. You must also ensure that your thesis submission is properly formatted to [Graduate College guidelines](https://grad.illinois.edu/academics/thesis-dissertation/format-requirements). Incomplete or improperly formatted thesis manuscripts may be rejected by the Department or Graduate College.

## Component Descriptions

### The MUP Portfolio

The MUP Portfolio is a holistic summary of your professional identity including polished examples that represent your practice as a planner. The professional portfolio should be designed to showcase your skills and tell a story of who you are as a professional planner. Show examples that you can tell stories about during an interview. Use the portfolio to communicate your design sense.

**Professional History and Goals** - Include a narrative description of your professional history which describes your professional goals and trajectory as well as your values as a professional. Include in your narrative statement a description of your professional goals for the five-year period after you complete your degree.

**Resume / CV** - Include an up to date version of your resume or curriculum vitae.

**Statement of Impact** - Include a narrative statement describing your vision for the type of impact which you aspire to have in your area or field of work.

**Statement of Leadership** - Include a narrative statement describing your vision for leadership in your area or field of work.

**Work Samples** - Include work samples that best illustrate your professional trajectory and capabilities. Include work samples from your core courses, electives, internship (if applicable and you have permission), capstone, and any other contexts that are relevant.

You may choose the format and structure for your portfolio - this could be an document intended for print, could be a website, or could take another format of your choice. You will need to provide a durable record which the department can evaluate. We also hope that this portfolio will be an important resource as you pursue your next professional or academic steps as you prepare to graduate.

### The MUP Poster

The MUP Poster is a place for you to summarize one significant work that represents your mastery of key urban planning skills. You may choose which work completed during the MUP program which you want to showcase on your poster. For those students pursuing the Project or Thesis capstone pathways, you may choose to design a poster based upon your capstone deliverable, however, this is not required. Likewise, students who completed the workshop pathway may design a poster based upon their contributions to the overall workshop deliverable, however, the poster should focus on distinct individual contributions rather than on the overall workshop outputs. Individuals who completed a group project have the option of designing companion posters with one printed poster per group member.

You will recieve feedback on your draft poster during a poster markup event in April. You will print and display your final poster at the Planning at Illinois capstone reception in May.

#### Poster Formatting Guidelines

Your poster should be a polished and visually engaging summary of a key piece of work you completed as part of your MUP degree. All posters must meet the following requirements:

-   The printed poster should be 30" x 40" (portrait or landscape orientation).

-   Your Name - Master of Urban Planning

-   Department of Urban + Regional Planning

-   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

-   The semester in which you are graduating (e.g. Spring 2025)

### The Capstone Exit Form

The Capstone Exit Form is the main transmittal form for your final capstone products. For students pursuing the workshop option, the Graduate Advisor will sign your capstone exit form, certifying that you have completed two UP 510 Plan Making Workshop courses. For students pursuing the Project or Thesis options, your project or thesis advisor will sign the form indicating that you have satisfactorily completed your project or have successfully defended and deposited your thesis.
